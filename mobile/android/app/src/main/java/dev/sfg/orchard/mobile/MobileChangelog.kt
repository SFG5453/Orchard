        - **Audio Version Matching**: Reject a search result when its runtime is too different from the selected track, even if the title and artist match.
        - **Search Result Durations**: Read the runtime when a play count follows it in YouTube Music search results.
        - **Playlist Additions**: Save the same album-audio version used for playback when creating a playlist or adding a track to one.
