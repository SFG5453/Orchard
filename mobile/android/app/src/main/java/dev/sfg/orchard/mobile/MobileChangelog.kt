        - **Public Stream Playback**: Fixed public YouTube tracks failing with CDN errors by routing every quality tier through NewPipe while preserving the selected bitrate.
        - **Public Stream Downloads**: Downloads now use the same quality-aware public resolver as playback, while account-only uploads retain the Innertube fallback.
